 I am a first year master's student at Georgia Institute of Technology, working in the Brain Lab under Prof. Melody Jackson and Prof. Thad Starner on in-ear EEG devices. 
                        
I am interested in software development, especially the ones handling big data. I worked at Adobe, on the Experience Design (XD) product as as Software Development Engineer. Prior to that, I was a Research Intern at Adobe Big Data Labs.
