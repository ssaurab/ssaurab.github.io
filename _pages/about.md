 I am a first year master's student at Georgia Institute of Technology, working in the Brain Lab under Prof. Melody Jackson and Prof. Thad Starner on in-ear EEG devices. 
                        
I am interested in developing software, especially the ones handling big data. I worked at Adobe, on the Experience Design (XD) product as as Software Development Engineer. Prior to that, I was a Research Intern at Adobe Big Data Labs. 

I graduated majoring in Computer Science and Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras in 2020, where I worked in the Center for Computational Brain Research on Deep Learning projects.

I love physics, and I try to keep up with latest developments in astrophysics. I competed in various Physics and Math olympiads, and won a gold medal in the Indian Physics Olympiad in 2016. 

I also enjoy volunteering and I was the Project Administrator of the [National Service Scheme, IIT Madras](https://nss.iitm.ac.in/event.html) leading 250 volunteers across 15 projects, totaling over 10,000 volunteer hours.
