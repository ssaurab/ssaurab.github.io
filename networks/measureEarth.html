    <h1>Measuring the diameter of earth using Traceroute</h1>
  
    <p>Check out the original paper here <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0208087.pdf" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-file" style="font-size:24px"></i></a></p>

        I came across a popular post on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30696499" target="_blank">Hacker News</a> on estimating the size of earth by observing the RTT times using Traceroute command. I found the construction of such an experiment to be a tricky yet an interesting one. So I conducted some experiments myself.

        First, let us examine the organization of submarines cables across the world. <a href="https://www.submarinecablemap.com/" target="_blank">Source</a>

        Since I currently reside in Atlanta, it is unfortunate to see that there are no direct cables from the nearest costal city to anywhere in Europe of Africa. However, I realized that this is a non-issue as soon as I ran my traceroute command to <i>University of London</i> at <a href="www.london.ac.uk" target="_blank">www.london.ac.uk</a>.

        From here, as the paper argues, since it is a known fact that the electromagnetic signals travel at two-thirds the speed of light in optical fibres that connects NY to London, it is easy to arrive at a rough first estimate for the distance between these cities.
